🚧 In a previous life I was an engineer in electronics/mechanics, and I also hold a PhD in applied maths for fluid mechanics.

I work mostly with these languages:&nbsp;<img height=20 src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=julia,bash,python,latex,fortran,c,cpp,rust"/>.

My workflow also involves these tools:&nbsp;<img height=20 src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sublime,github,git,md,html,cmake,stackoverflow,regex"/>.

And on&nbsp;<img height=20 src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ubuntu,linux"/>&nbsp;of course.
